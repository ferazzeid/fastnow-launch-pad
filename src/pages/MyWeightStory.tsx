              I was extremely slim when I was young. I did a lot of biking, played football, spent hours outside. 
              Food wasn't something I thought about — it was just a necessity. I didn't plan meals, didn't crave snacks, 
              didn't think of food as pleasure. It was just there. My life was active, and my body stayed lean because of it.
            </p>

            <p>
              But when I got older — post-teenage years — things changed. I stopped riding the bike. I stopped playing football. 
              I moved less. And I ate more. A lot more. Alcoholic beverages came into my life. After-parties, late-night pizzas, 
              beer, constant sandwiches at university — it all crept in. My food habits got worse, and very quickly, my weight 
              started to climb. In my early 20s, I went from being extremely slim to wearing European suit size 58. 
              That's a massive transformation in a very short period of time.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>And ever since then, I've struggled with weight.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              I tried different things. I joined fitness classes. I tried running. I bought a bike again. And sure, 
              these things helped a little. But I never got back to my ideal weight. Not even close.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-8 my-8">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Breakthrough Period</h2>
              <p>
                Years later, everything changed for a while. I did a voluntary service in an elderly home — part of a 
                government program — where I worked as an assistant gardener. I was surrounded by slim, physically active people. 
                They were constantly moving. Food wasn't central to their lives — it was just lunch, and then back to work.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this time, I made a decision to cut down food intake drastically. For lunch, I would have a tuna sandwich 
                and a cucumber salad. Often after a morning gym workout. I honestly don't remember exactly what I ate in the 
                evenings — probably something light, maybe chicken breast and a small portion of rice. But I remember the lunch clearly. 
                And the effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>In six months, I lost over 25 kilograms.</strong> Around month four or five, the jeans I was wearing literally 
                fell off. I had to buy new clothes. I hit just over 80 kg — from well over 100 kg — and I was in the best shape of my life. 
                I joined a dance class. Girls loved dancing with me. I was confident, and people noticed. Some people even became jealous. 
                Close friends didn't know how to react — I had changed.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              But then I went back to my previous job. Back to the office. Back to the old life. Slowly, the old habits returned. 
              Eating, drinking, emotional situations. I was around people who smoked, overate, partied. And within three years, 
              I had regained the weight. I was back in the 115 kg range. And I felt horrible. Physically, mentally, emotionally.
            </p>

            <p>
              Again, I tried to lose the weight. And again, I had partial success. I managed to reduce a few kilograms — 
              but I couldn't get back below 100 kg. I didn't know why. I couldn't find the energy or the discipline. I was lost.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over time, as I aged, the weight crept even higher. By the time I was in my early 40s — 43 or 44 — I was at an 
              all-time high: <strong>120 kg</strong>. I only found out because I went to a doctor. I had symptoms that felt like asthma. 
              Breathing issues. Fatigue. Mysterious allergic reactions. She ordered tests, and although nothing was critically wrong, 
              it was obvious something was off. My insulin levels were consistently too high. I didn't feel good in my body. 
              I knew something had to change.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-8 my-8">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Clean Eating Experiment</h2>
              <p>
                So I cut all carbs. For a full year. No pasta, no rice, no potatoes, no bread. Nothing. I only ate clean, 
                healthy food: fish, vegetables, olive oil, salads. But after a while… I started to gain weight again. 
                I couldn't believe it. How could I gain weight on healthy food?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>That's when I realized something critical: just because food is healthy doesn't mean it's low-calorie.</strong> 
                Olive oil is dense. Feta cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers — they all add up. I was overeating clean food. 
                And the weight came back.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              About a year later, I stopped everything. I sat down and looked at the past 10–15 years. I asked: 
              <em>what had worked before?</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The answer was clear: fasting.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Water fasting was the only thing that consistently gave me results. Not easy results. But real ones. 
              It gave me momentum. A mental reset. A metabolic shift. It wasn't something I could do often — once or twice a year, 
              maximum. But it was the spark I needed. And every single time I did it, I felt better. I looked better. 
              I had hope again.
            </p>

            <p>
              But fasting alone wasn't enough. I had to follow it with something that actually worked — not just cutting carbs, 
              but understanding calories. Portion sizes. Food density. I had made the mistake of eating too much healthy food 
              without understanding how much energy it actually carried.
            </p>

            <p>
              That's when I started immersing myself in the topic. I watched videos. I read posts. I wrote things down. 
              I tried different combinations. And over time — especially in the last two years — I finally figured out what works for me.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-accent-green/5 border border-accent-green/20 rounded-lg p-8 my-8">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Walking Discovery</h2>
              <p>
                But it required another realization too: I needed movement. And not just occasional gym visits or sports — 
                something that would stick. That's when I found walking.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Walking changed everything.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                It was simple. I could do it anywhere — in nature, in the city, while traveling. I could take calls, 
                listen to podcasts, reflect. And most importantly: it burned real calories. It created space in my daily intake. 
                It allowed me to eat something extra and still be in a deficit.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-900 text-white rounded-lg p-8 my-8">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Final Formula</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">So I put it all together:</p>
              <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
                <li>A 3-day water fast to initiate momentum</li>
                <li>A low-carb, calorie-controlled diet with a very limited food selection</li>
                <li>Walking every single day</li>
                <li>Full mental immersion into the topic</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-4">
                <strong>This formula — after years of trial, error, failure, confusion, and frustration — finally works.</strong>
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              I'm using it right now, as I write this. And because it's working so well, I decided to share it — 
              with the hope that someone else can use what I've learned to build their own success. You can use the protocol. 
              You can use the app I created to support it. Or not. That's your choice.
            </p>

            <p>
              But if you're ready — and if you want to try something real — you now have my exact example.
