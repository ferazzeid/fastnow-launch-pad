## Security Features Added

### AuthService Class
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **Session Management**: Encrypted session tokens with expiration
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: Cleans user inputs to prevent XSS
- **Permission System**: Role-based access control

### Security Headers Component
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy implementation
- **XSS Protection**: X-XSS-Protection headers
- **Frame Protection**: X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF prevention

### Secure API Endpoints
- **XSS Prevention**: Replaced innerHTML with safe DOM methods
- **Content Type**: Proper JSON content type headers
- **Input Validation**: Server-side input validation

## Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- Secure hashing with bcrypt
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Default admin password changed to `admin123!`

## Session Security
- Encrypted session storage
- 24-hour session expiration
- Secure token generation
- Automatic session cleanup

## Rate Limiting
- Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes
- Account lockout: 15 minutes after 5 failed attempts
- Per-IP rate limiting for authentication

## Deployment Security Checklist

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Production Deployment Steps

1. **Change Default Credentials**
   - Login with admin/admin123!
   - Immediately change admin password to a strong password
   - Create additional admin users as needed

2. **Environment Variables** (Future Enhancement)
   - Move encryption keys to environment variables
   - Use proper secret management in production
   - Consider integrating with Supabase for backend security

3. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Ensure SSL/TLS certificates are properly configured
   - Add HSTS headers in server configuration
   - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS

4. **Server-Side Security** (Recommended)
   - Consider moving to server-side authentication
   - Implement proper API rate limiting at server level
   - Add database-level security controls

## Remaining Security Considerations

### High Priority
- [ ] Move to server-side authentication (Supabase recommended)
- [ ] Implement proper API with server-side validation
- [ ] Add database-level security controls
- [ ] Implement audit logging

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication
- [ ] Implement password complexity requirements
- [ ] Add email verification for new users
- [ ] Implement password reset functionality

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement advanced CSRF protection
- [ ] Add API versioning and deprecation
- [ ] Security penetration testing

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Least Privilege**: Users only get minimum required permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
4. **Secure Defaults**: Secure configuration by default
5. **Fail Securely**: Systems fail to a secure state
6. **Security Through Obscurity**: Sensitive information not exposed

## Testing the Security Fixes

### Authentication Testing
1. Try logging in with old credentials (admin/admin) - should fail
2. Try logging in with new credentials (admin/admin123!) - should succeed
3. Try 6 failed login attempts - account should lock
4. Check session expiration after 24 hours

### XSS Testing
1. Visit API endpoints directly - should display JSON safely
2. Try entering HTML/JavaScript in form fields - should be sanitized
3. Check that no innerHTML usage remains in codebase

### Authorization Testing
1. Access admin routes without authentication - should redirect
2. Try accessing admin features as viewer - should be denied
3. Test role-based permissions work correctly

## Emergency Security Response

If security issues are discovered:
1. Immediately change all admin passwords
2. Clear all user sessions: `localStorage.clear()`
3. Review audit logs for suspicious activity
4. Consider temporarily disabling user registration
