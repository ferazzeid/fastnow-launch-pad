  'What is FastNow and how is it different from other fasting or weight loss apps?',
  'FastNow is a minimalist, protocol-driven app built for people who want to immerse themselves in a proven system—without endless settings or distractions. It''s not just another calorie tracker or fasting timer. FastNow is about deep focus: recording, reflecting, and getting honest with yourself. The app is stripped down to core essentials, supports your goals with a powerful deficit feature, motivator logging, and clean daily workflow. You''re not getting bombarded with notifications, fake encouragements, or gimmicks—just tools to help you take real control.',

  'Do I need to count calories to make progress with FastNow?',
  'To make real progress, you need to immerse yourself in the process. FastNow is built for that. When you start tracking, you stop guessing. You see exactly what''s going on in your day-to-day choices. People are shocked the first time they realize that a salad with olive oil can have more calories than a Big Mac at McDonald''s. Or that "just a few nuts" can turn into 300 calories, no problem. Most diets fail not because people aren''t trying — but because they have no idea how quickly healthy food can still break the deficit.

Logging food is how you learn what''s actually happening, not just what you hope is happening. You spot the patterns. You notice the habits that quietly drain your results. Even more important, you avoid the slow-failure trap: weeks of effort with so little change you lose all motivation. Too small a deficit means you technically "win" every day, but you never see or feel a result.

Immersion means getting close to the truth of your own numbers, your own habits, your own body. That''s the difference between "doing a diet" and actually changing. Over time, you''ll build real confidence, and tracking will fade into the background. But until then, this is the fastest way to make your effort count.',

  'How does the deficit feature work, and why does it matter?',
  'The deficit is the backbone of the FastNow protocol. The body''s metabolism is complicated, but at the core of any real weight loss is the energy equation: calories in, calories out. You could chase hormone tweaks, macro ratios, meal timing, and a thousand other details—but unless you create a meaningful deficit, nothing else works. FastNow helps you lock onto this number. You make sure that what goes in is less than what you burn, day after day, and you keep that deficit big enough to see real progress. If your deficit is too small, you might be technically "winning," but you''ll never feel the change. This is how you break out of that trap and actually move the needle.',

  'Can I use FastNow for any style of fasting (intermittent, extended, water-only, etc.)?',
  'FastNow supports both intermittent fasting and longer water fasts. The app lets you track eating windows if that''s your style, but also makes it easy to time and log water fasts for a day or several. Intermittent fasting is great as an on-ramp—it gets you used to saying no, sitting with hunger, and resetting your patterns. But if you want to see a dramatic shift and snap out of carb addiction, a proper water fast is where most people break through. FastNow is built to let you use either approach, or transition from one to the other, based on what actually fits your needs.',

  'What are motivators, and how do they help with progress?',
  'Motivators are more than reminders—they''re part of your immersion. When your willpower fades, when you''re in a negotiation with yourself, your motivators are your leverage. FastNow lets you log your deepest reasons for change, add images, and keep them visible as part of your daily journey. You can add as much detail as you need. The strongest motivators will be personal—sometimes even painful. But when you''re staring down a craving, or about to break a fast, this is the ammo that gets you through. It''s not magic, but sometimes the right reminder at the right time is the only thing between you and a breakthrough.',

  'Do I need to log everything I eat and do every single day?',
  'You don''t need to log forever. But in the beginning, logging every meal and fast is the quickest way to immerse yourself in the process, spot hidden mistakes, and rewire your habits. FastNow makes this as easy as possible—voice entry, one-tap foods, motivator recall. Once you have a feel for your patterns and the numbers behind them, you can dial back. But if you skip this step, you risk flying blind.',

  'Is there AI involved in FastNow, and how does it work?',
  'Yes—AI in FastNow is used for one thing: making your life easier where it actually counts. With the premium version, you get voice input for foods and motivators, automatic food analysis, and easy auto-filling of nutrition data. It helps you save time and lowers friction, especially when you''re eating the same foods often. That''s it. FastNow isn''t an AI coach or chat bot. You''re in charge. If you want real conversation or deep coaching, use a tool like ChatGPT during your fasts. FastNow just keeps the process efficient.',

(
  'Can I use FastNow for free, or is there a paid version?',
  'You can use FastNow for free, but you''ll have to enter most foods and motivators manually. For people who like routines and eat similar foods day after day, this is no problem. The paid version unlocks the AI features, voice entry, and future advanced tools. Both versions are fully functional for the basics.',

  'Will FastNow work on my phone or do I need to install anything?',
  'FastNow is a web-based app designed for your phone—no download required. Just log in and use it anywhere, anytime. A dedicated Android and iOS version is in the works, but the current web app is optimized for mobile and ready to go.',
