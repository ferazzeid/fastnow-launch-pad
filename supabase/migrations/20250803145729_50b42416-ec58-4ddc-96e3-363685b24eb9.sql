  '"I was extremely slim when I was young. I biked everywhere, played football, spent hours outside. Food was just fuel — I didn''t crave it, plan it, or obsess over it. My body stayed lean because my life was active.\n\nThen came adulthood. The bike rides stopped. Football stopped. I moved less and ate more. Alcohol crept in, late-night pizzas, beer, endless sandwiches at university. My weight shot up. In my early 20s, I went from lean to European suit size 58 in just a few years. And ever since, I''ve been in a battle with my weight.\n\nI tried gyms, running, even buying another bike. I had small wins but never got close to my ideal weight — until one breakthrough period.\n\nI spent six months working as an assistant gardener as part of a government program. I was surrounded by slim, active people, always on the move. I cut my food intake drastically — lunches were a tuna sandwich and cucumber salad, often after a morning gym session. By month four or five, the jeans I was wearing literally fell off. I lost over 25 kg and hit just over 80 kg. I felt confident, alive, and people noticed.\n\nBut I returned to office life, and old habits came back — eating, drinking, social pressures. Within three years, I''d regained the weight.\n\nThe years that followed were filled with attempts to fix it: low-carb diets, clean eating, exercise routines. They all worked a bit — until they didn''t. I even discovered you can have too much of a good thing. Healthy food is still food, and everything good comes in moderation. Eventually, the weight crept up again.\n\nBy my early 40s, I hit 120 kg. I was tired, sluggish, and my insulin levels were consistently high. That''s when I looked back and asked: what had actually worked before?\n\nThe answer was clear — fasting.\n\nWater fasting was the only thing that truly reset my body and mind. Not easy, but effective. I couldn''t do it all the time, but it gave me momentum. And this time, I paired it with something sustainable: a simple low-carb, calorie-aware diet and daily walking.\n\nWalking became my secret weapon. It was easy, flexible, and burned real calories without feeling like a chore.\n\nThat combination — short water fasts, simple diet, daily walking, and complete mental focus — became my FastNow protocol.\n\nOn this site, I''ll tell you exactly what I did. You don''t need a program, you don''t need an app — it''s simple, and it works for most people.\n\nBut I am building the FastNow app to help you get through it more consistently, stay immersed in the effort, and remove the need for long preparation.
