  'The suggested food list is very restrictive. Why is that, and is it really feasible to eat like that?',
  'The big problem with achieving a proper deficit while keeping carbs low is that the foods that fit these rules are actually limited. I tried to find more options, but there simply aren''t many that work. I''m not interested in fancy or niche products—what matters is that the foods are available everywhere, easy to record, and predictable in nutrition. I want staple items that don''t require complicated prep, weird measuring, or splitting giant portions.

That''s why the list is so tight. If something made the cut, it''s because it''s practical and reliable in real life, not just in theory. It might feel restrictive at first, but that''s what makes it possible to stick to the protocol and get results you can trust.

And honestly, if food variety is still your top priority, you might not be ready to really immerse yourself in this protocol. At this point, your motivators should be so strong that you''ll do whatever it takes to reach your goals. When you''re hungry and focused, even these simple foods will start to look—and taste—amazing. What feels restrictive now will feel like a reward soon enough.',

  'What kind of results can you expect, and in what kind of timeframe on average?',
  'It''s tough to give one answer because everyone starts at a different place. I can only tell you what I''ve experienced myself and what the math says. If you have special conditions, you''ll need to talk to your doctor. But generally, if you create and track a real calorie deficit, the numbers do check out.

I don''t use a scale to measure my progress—I use clothes. When you track your intake closely and keep your carbs low, you can estimate fat loss pretty well. In FastNow, there''s a feature that shows your projected weight loss over 30 days, based on your daily deficit.

Here''s how it breaks down:
If you maintain a 1,000 calorie deficit daily, that''s roughly 100–130 grams of fat lost per day. Multiply by 30 days and you''re looking at about 3–4 kg per month. The first month is usually even faster, because you lose a lot of water weight at the start—so your initial drop could be 6–8 kg, depending on your size and how strict you are.

What does that mean in real life? One suit size down in the first month is very realistic. After two months, clothes that used to be too tight will suddenly fit perfectly again. Old favorites come back into rotation. You feel the change, even if you never step on a scale. For me, this was the most motivating feedback I could get.

Results will slow down a bit over time, but as long as you keep the deficit up and stick to the protocol, the changes keep coming. No tricks, just real progress you can see and feel.',

  'Why do you recommend not weighing yourself and instead use clothes as your progress measurement?',
  'When you''re struggling with weight, it''s easy to get obsessed with the scale. The number can get stuck for days or even go up for no clear reason. That''s demotivating. And honestly, the number itself doesn''t matter—what matters is how you look, how you feel, and whether your clothes fit. That''s what I care about.

Early on, I think it''s better to skip the scale entirely. Most people are starting from a number they don''t like, sometimes even one they''ve never seen before. If you''re not proud of that number, why focus on it every day? Clothes don''t lie. Everyone has things in their closet they used to fit into. That''s your real benchmark.

What I like to do is keep clothes that are a little too small—maybe even buy a couple of things one size down—and use them as milestones. As you lose weight, you''ll start to fit into them again. It''s a tangible win that feels better than any number.

Eventually, when you''ve made progress and you''re proud of your weight, you can go back to the scale if you want. Until then, I''d rather deal with a little ambiguity about exactly where the loss is happening, instead of obsessing over daily fluctuations and getting discouraged for no good reason.',

  'What are good motivators you would recommend?',
  'Inside the app, you''ll find recommended motivators you can use, but the real key is to personalize them. Don''t rush this step. When you set up a motivator, use a detailed description and, if you can, add a custom image. The more personal and vivid your motivator, the better it works—especially when your brain starts negotiating with you in a weak moment.

One of the strongest motivators is having a real event on the horizon: a wedding, a reunion, a vacation, something where you want to show up as your best. The social element and the time pressure make it powerful. Ideally, your event is at least a month or two away—two weeks is usually too short to see real change.

Another effective motivator is a specific piece of clothing you want to fit into again, or new clothes you want to be able to wear. This is tangible and motivating in a way that''s hard to argue with.

Don''t overlook health markers, either. If you''ve had a test come back with something out of range—high insulin, high blood sugar, whatever—it can be a huge push to get serious.

It can even be about a person: maybe you want to impress someone, or just feel more confident socially. Everyone''s motivators are different, but what matters is that it''s honest, specific, and means something to you. When you hit a tough spot, being able to reread and reconnect with your motivators is what can get you through.

Check out the examples in the app, but make them your own. The more real it feels to you, the more likely you''ll stick with it.',

  'What about liquids and drinking in general during the water fast or during restricted eating?',
  'Here''s what works for me:
During a water fast, I stick to water—plain, sparkling, or mineral water for a little variety. That''s the safest way to stay truly fasted and avoid surprises.

After the water fast, in my own eating window, I rely a lot on Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. Honestly, drinking just water is tough for me, and these drinks help me stay hydrated (and satisfied) throughout the day. I know some people worry about artificial sweeteners, possible insulin response, or other downsides. Personally, I don''t have a negative reaction, and for most people these drinks are fine—especially if it means you actually drink enough.

Ideally, yes, pure water would be best. But if you''re struggling with that, cold zero-sugar sodas can be a practical compromise. Sometimes I also drink coffee, which works for me, or swap in other zero-calorie sodas for variety. If you find water alone too boring or hard to maintain, it''s more important to stay hydrated—even if that means using Diet Coke or Pepsi as a tool.
Just keep an eye on how your body reacts, and adjust if something''s not working for you.',

  'What about fruits? Aren''t fruits healthy? Why are fruits not part of this protocol?',
  'Fruits are a tricky subject—everyone loves them, and we''ve all been told how healthy they are. Some people claim that fructose (the sugar in fruit) is different, or somehow "better," but my experience is simple: if you overeat on fruits, you gain weight, fast. They''re pure carbs, they spike your insulin, and they''re incredibly easy to overeat. That''s why, during the FastNow protocol, fruits are a hard no.

That sounds harsh, but the reality is that fruits are just too risky if your goal is to keep carbs low and drive fat loss. They''re healthy in some contexts, sure, but not when you''re trying to break carb addiction and reset your metabolism. So, on this protocol, it''s zero fruit—period.

I''ll be honest, though: after about three months, I started making a personal exception. If I''m in my garden and there''s a perfectly ripe peach or a handful of grapes on my own trees, I might pick and eat one or two, and I won''t bother to record it. I know there''s sugar in there, I know it adds to my daily total, but it''s a conscious choice—a small seasonal pleasure that fits my philosophy of living and working in my own garden. It''s not blind overeating, and it''s not something I''d ever do with store-bought fruit or in large quantities.

Other than that, fruits don''t fit the FastNow protocol. If you''re serious about getting results, skip them—at least for now.',
