  'What foods are allowed in the FastNow Protocol?',
  'The FastNow Protocol uses a simple, limited food selection for maximum effectiveness:

**Core Staples:**
• Eggs (boiled with salt)
• Cheese (hard and soft varieties like Brie, Camembert)
• Meats (chicken, ham, sliced sausage products)
• Fish (salmon, smoked salmon)
• Pickles (fermented, low-carb varieties)

**Sometimes Allowed:**
• Cucumbers (in moderation)
• Tomatoes (very selective use)
• Olives (if under calorie budget)

**Drinks:**
• Water and sparkling water
• Black coffee
• Coke Zero/Pepsi Max/Light sodas (yes, they help with hunger suppression)

**Never Eat:**
• All breads, rice, potatoes, pasta
• Sugar, sweets, junk food
• Fruits (even "healthy" ones)
• High-sugar vegetables (carrots, beets)
• Nuts, olive oil, butter (too calorie dense)

This simplified list eliminates decision fatigue and focuses on foods that support the low-carb, calorie-controlled approach. Don''t try to perfect it - just use it.',
